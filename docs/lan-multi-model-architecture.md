# LAN Multi-Model Deep Researcher Architecture

## Overview

The LAN Multi-Model Deep Researcher extends the local deep research capabilities by orchestrating multiple language models across Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure. This version enables distributed processing, load balancing, and specialized model utilization for different research tasks.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Model Discovery and Management

#### Automatic LAN Model Discovery
- **Ollama Discovery**: Auto-detect Ollama instances across LAN via service discovery (mDNS/Bonjour)
- **vLLM Discovery**: Detect vLLM OpenAI-compatible API endpoints on network
- **Custom Model Servers**: Support for custom inference servers (FastAPI, TensorRT-LLM, etc.)
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and performance monitoring of discovered models

#### Model Registry Service
```yaml
Model Registry:
  - Endpoint Discovery: Automatic detection of inference endpoints
  - Capability Mapping: Model capabilities (reasoning, summarization, code, etc.)
  - Performance Profiling: Latency, throughput, and quality metrics
  - Load Balancing: Distribute requests based on model capacity
  - Failover Handling: Automatic failover to backup models
```

### 2. Distributed Query Processing

#### Intelligent Task Distribution
- **Query Routing**: Route different types of queries to specialized models
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute multiple research loops simultaneously across models
- **Result Aggregation**: Combine and synthesize results from multiple models
- **Quality Scoring**: Compare and rank outputs from different models

#### Specialized Model Assignment
```python
Query Types and Model Assignment:
- Literature Search: Fast, efficient smaller models
- Analysis & Reasoning: Larger reasoning-optimized models
- Code Analysis: Specialized code models (Code Llama variants, DeepSeek-Coder)
- Scientific Writing: Academic-focused and domain-specific models
- Summarization: Optimized smaller models for speed
```

### 3. Advanced Research Orchestration

#### Multi-Model Research Pipeline
1. **Initial Query Analysis**: Fast model determines research strategy
2. **Parallel Search Execution**: Multiple models search different aspects
3. **Cross-Validation**: Models validate each other's findings
4. **Synthesis**: Specialized synthesis model combines all findings
5. **Quality Assurance**: Final review by most capable model

#### Research Strategies
- **Ensemble Research**: Multiple models research the same topic for consensus
- **Specialized Research**: Different models focus on different aspects
- **Iterative Refinement**: Models build upon each other's findings
- **Comparative Analysis**: Models provide different perspectives on findings

### 4. Load Balancing and Optimization

#### Intelligent Load Distribution
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track GPU utilization, memory usage, and response times
- **Dynamic Routing**: Route requests to least loaded capable models
- **Batching Optimization**: Group similar requests for efficient processing
- **Priority Queuing**: Prioritize research tasks based on complexity and urgency

#### Performance Optimization
- **Model Warm-up**: Keep frequently used models loaded and ready
- **Request Caching**: Cache similar queries to reduce redundant processing
- **Result Streaming**: Stream partial results for better user experience
- **Adaptive Timeouts**: Adjust timeouts based on model performance
